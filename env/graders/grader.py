"""Deterministic grader for CloudSense tasks.

Computes the final task score (0.0-1.0) based on actions taken during an episode.
Same input always produces the same output.

Deduplication policy: If an agent acts on the same resource twice, only the FIRST
action counts for grading. This is by design — first-action-only grading prevents
score inflation from repeated attempts on the same resource and rewards decisive,
well-reasoned first moves.
